# Assembly-Brick-Breaker
This is the break breaker, breakout game written in assembly language.

Pablo Parra's simulator I used: https://github.com/parraman/asm-simulator:
"A web-based simulator of a 16-bit CPU. This project has been developed for educational purposes to support the
teaching of the Operating Systems course of the Degree in Computer Engineering of the University of Alcal√°."
